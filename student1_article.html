                Sri Lankabhimanya Wannakuwatta Waduge Don Albert Perera better 
                known by his adopted name Amaradeva, was a prominent Sri Lankan vocalist, 
                violinist and composer. Primarily using traditional instruments 
                like sitars, tablas and harmoniums, Amaradeva incorporates Sinhala 
                folk music with Indian ragas in his work. Many consider Pandit Amaradevaâ€™s 
                contribution to the development of Sinhala music is priceless. So he is 
                occasionally cited as the Maestro of Sri Lanka Music.
                This legend was born in 5th December 1927 in Moratuwa, Sri Lanka as the youngest 
                child of Wannakuwatta Waduge Don Ginoris Perera, and Balapuwaduge Maggie Weslina Mendis.
                Perera was a buddhist while Mendis was a Methodist bringing both Christian and Buddhist 
                values and music traditions to the family. Amaradeva was introduced to music at a young age by his father who crafted
                and repaired violins at a Carpentry School. Another family influence was Amaradeva's 
                elder brother who taught Indian classical music to him.

            <p class="para2">
                Amaradeva obtained his early education under Ven. Malalankara Nayaka Tero of the Koralawella temple. With the development 
                of his musical talent, Amaradeva was asked to recite poems and prayers at the
                 temple; he was subsequently picked to lead the village choir.He was first entered 
                 into Sri Saddharmodaya Buddhist mixed School in Koralawella. The principal of that 
                 school, Mr. Ku. Jo. Fernando was an active member of Hela Hawula and had a close 
                 connection with Kumaratunga Munidasa. He knew about Amaradeva's talent and introduced 
                 him to Kumaratunga. Amaradeva was lucky to be appreciated by Kumaratunga for his singing 
                 talent. Since he had a chance to accompany all these scholars during his childhood, he 
                 had an interest in national identity and language. When he was studying in grade five at 
                 Koralawella School, a music teacher called Mr. W. J. Fernando was transferred to his school
                  from Kalutara. Hence, W.J. Fernando was the first school music teacher of Amaradeva. He realized 
                  Amaradeva's talent and directed him on singing and playing. Under his guidance, Amaradeva won all
                   the school singing competitions. Even the teacher let him conduct the classroom when he was not there.
