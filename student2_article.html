           <h1>HOW MUSIC HELP FOR MENTAL HEALTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL</h1>
           <p>
            What is Music Therapy?<br><br>
            Music Therapy is the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved music therapy program. 
            It is an established health service similar to occupationaltherapy and physical therapy and consists of using music therapeutically to address physical,
            psychological, cognitive and/or social functioning for patients of all ages. Because music therapy is a powerful
            and non-invasive medium, unique outcomes are possible. In addition to its applications in mental health, music therapy
             is used successfully in a variety of additional healthcare and educational settings.
           </p>
           <p>
            How Does Music Therapy Make a Difference for Persons with Mental Health Needs?<br><br>
            Music  therapy  is  an  efﬁcacious  and  valid  treatment  for  persons  who  have  psychosocial, 
            affective, cognitive and communicative needs. Research results and clinical experiences attest to 
            the viability of music therapy even in those who are resistive to other treatment approaches.  
            Music is a form of sensory stimulation that provokes responses due to the familiarity, 
            predictability and feelings of security associated with it.   Music therapy for clients with mental 
            health concerns uses musical interaction as a means of communication and expression. The aim of 
            therapy is to help individuals develop relationships and address issues they may not be able to 
            address using words alone. Music
            therapy sessions include the use of active music making, music listening, and discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
             It can help treat mental illness <br><br>
             Music literally changes the brain. Neurological researchers have found that listening to music triggers the
             release of several neurochemicals that play a role in brain function and mental health:
              <ul>
                <li> dopamine, a chemical associated with pleasure and “reward” centers</li>
                <li>stress hormones like cortisol</li> 
                <li>serotonin and other hormones related to immunity</li> 
                <li> oxytocin, a chemical that fosters the ability to connect to others</li> 
              </ul>
                
                Although more research needs to be done to understand precisely how music can be used therapeutically to treat mental illness, some studiesTrusted Source suggest that music therapy can improve the quality of life and social connectedness for people with schizophrenia.
            </p>
            <p>
                It can help lower anxiety <br><br>
                There’s lots of evidence that listening to music can help calm you in situations where you might feel anxious. <br>
                StudiesTrusted Source have shown that people in rehab after a stroke are more relaxed once they’ve listened to music for an hour. <br>
                Similar studiesTrusted Source indicate that music blended with nature sounds help people feel less anxious. Even people facing critical illnessTrusted Source feel less anxiety after music therapy. <br>
                There’s conflicting evidence about whether listening to music has an effect on your body’s physiological stress response, however. One studyTrusted Source indicated that the body releases less cortisol, a stress hormone, when people listen to music. This same study referenced previous research stating that music had little measurable effect on cortisol levels. <br>
                One recent studyTrusted Source that measured several indicators of stress (not just cortisol) concluded that while listening to music before a stressful event doesn’t reduce anxiety, listening to relaxing music after a stressful event can help your nervous system recover faster. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                It helps the symptoms of depression <br><br>
                A 2017 research reviewTrusted Source concluded that listening to music, particularly classical combined with jazz, had a positive effect on depression symptoms, especially when there were several listening sessions conducted by board certified music therapists. <br><br>
                Not into jazz or the classics? You may want to try a group percussion session instead. The same research review found that drum circles also had above-average benefits for people dealing with depression. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                It can help your heart health <br>
                Music can make you want to move — and the benefits of dancing are well documented. Scientists also know that listening to music can alterTrusted Source your breath rate, your heart rate, and your blood pressure, depending on the music’s intensity and tempo.

            </p>   
            <p>
                It decreases fatigue <br>
                Anyone who has ever rolled down car windows and turned up the radio knows that music can be energizing. There’s solid science behind that lived experience.
               In 2015, researchersTrusted Source at Shanghai University found that relaxing music helped reduce fatigue and maintain muscle endurance when people were engaged in a repetitive task.
               Music therapy sessions also lessened fatigue in people receiving cancer treatments and raised the fatigue threshold for people engaged in demanding neuromuscular training, which leads us to the next big benefit.
               
            </p>   
            <p>
                It boosts exercise performance <br>
               Exercise enthusiasts have long known that music enhances their physical performance. <br>
               A 2020 research review confirms that working out with music improves your mood, helps your body exercise more efficiently, and cuts down on your awareness of exertion. Working out with music also leads to longer workoutsTrusted Source.
               In clinical settings, athletes who listened to high-intensity, fast music during warmups were motivatedTrusted Source to perform better competitively.
               You don’t have to be a world-class competitor to benefit: ResearchTrusted Source shows that syncing your workout to music can allow you to reach peak performance using less oxygen than if you did the same workout without the beat. Music acts as a metronome in your body, researchers said.
               
            </p>   
            <p>
                It can help manage pain <br>
               Specially trained music therapists use music to help alleviate pain in inpatient and outpatient settings. A 2016 meta-analysisTrusted Source of over 90 studies reported that music helps people manage both acute and chronic pain better than medication alone.

            </p>   
            <p>
                The takeaway <br>
               Music exerts a powerful influence on human beings. It can boost memory, build task endurance, lighten your mood, reduce anxiety and depression, stave off fatigue, improve your response to pain, and help you work out more effectively.
               Working with a music therapist is one effective way to take advantage of the many benefits music can have on your body, mind, and overall health.
