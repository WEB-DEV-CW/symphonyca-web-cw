       <br> <p class="para"> Music has played a very important role in society. All cultures, villages, etc. they have their own musical manifestations, but while many of these manifestations have features in common, their differences are what makes them stand out. What is characteristic, unique, and different about each culture is what leads us to diversity and plurality.
        The applications that music may have will depend on the cultural context, location, and other factors. Diversity is given by the instruments used, the methods, how the voice is emitted, how the rhythm and melodies are treated, where and how the music is applied and in what way — and so on.
        We must never forget the variety we have, which we are very lucky for, as it allows for very extensive documentation and learning. At the same time, taking into account this diversity, we can share some concepts and isolate others, so that we treat with great care and respect what we don’t know, what is foreign to us.
        
           Music has great qualities of healing a person emotionally and mentally.
            Music is a form of meditation. While composing or listening music ones tends to forget all
             his worries, sorrows and pains. But, in order to appreciate good music, we need to cultivate our
              musical taste. It can be cited that in the Dwapar Yug, the Gopis would get mesmerized with the
               music that flowed from Lord Krishna’s flute. They would surrender themselves to Him. Also the research has
            proved that the plants which hear the Music grow at a faster rate in comparison to the others.It has the power to cure diseases such as anxiety, 
            depression, insomnia, etc. The power of Music can be testified by the legends about Tansen of his bringing the rains by singing Raag Megh Malhar and lighting lamps by Raga Deepak.
             It also helps in improving
             the concentration and is thus of great help to the students.Music is the essence of life.
              Everything that has rhythm has music. Our breathing also has a rhythm.
               Thus, we can say that there is music in every human being or a living creature. 
               Music has the ability to convey all sorts of emotions to people. Music is also a very powerful means to connect with God. We can conclude that Music is the purest form of
              worship of God and to connect with our soul.
              <br>
              Music is known as the Universal language because it knows no boundaries. It flows freely beyond the barriers of language, religion, country, etc.
               Anybody can enjoy music irrespective of his age.
               It spreads happiness and joy in a person’s life. Music is the soul of life and gives immense peace to us. In the words of William Shakespeare, “If music is the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it; that surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die.” Thus,
                Music helps us in connecting with our souls or real self.Music can raise someone's mood, 
                get them excited, or make them calm and relaxed. Music also - and this is important - allows us 
                to feel nearly or possibly all emotions that we experience in our lives. ... It is an important
                 part of their lives and fills
                 a need or an urge to create music.
                 <br>
                 Playing music also relaxes the mind and slows down the tension. Interested people find pleasure in playing his favorite instrument. A piano or a guitar strings can give pleasure to a stressed mind.
